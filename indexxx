Thus, he attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to practice magic under the guidance of the kindly headmaster Albus Dumbledore and other school professors along with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.

At the age of eleven, she learned about her magical nature and was accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

She possessed a brilliant academic mind and proved to be a gifted student in almost every subject that she studied.Hermione first met Harry Potter and Ron Weasley aboard the Hogwarts Express, who found her unfriendly and somewhat of an "insufferable know-it-all", an impression reinforced by her constant correct answers and eagerness to please the professors. However, she stepped in to take the blame from the boys after they had saved her from a troll on Hallowe'en in 1991, surprising them in a grateful way and quickly becoming friends.</p>
